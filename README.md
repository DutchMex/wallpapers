# Wallpapers

This Repo is a collection of cool wallpapers I have found that specifically compliment different opperating systems, such as Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.

Just an example of the kinds of wallpapers here:

- Mac OS Wallpapers by [Basic Apple Guy](https://basicappleguy.com)
- Community made wallpapers that compliment the Framework Laptops
- Community made Windows 11 reskins
- And many more!

I have not created any of these, nor do I have the rights to sell them or anything like that. They are just downloads so that I can find them more easily in the future.
